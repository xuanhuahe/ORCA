## Introduction

Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency—they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. To address this gap, we introduce **ORCA** (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), a framework that enables active intelligence by formulating avatar control as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP).

ORCA treats an Image-to-Video (I2V) model as a world simulator, allowing an agent to infer the world state from observations and plan coherent action sequences to achieve high-level intentions.

## L-IVA Benchmark

To systematically evaluate active intelligence, we propose the **L-IVA** (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar) benchmark.

**Task Composition**: Includes 100 tasks across 5 real-world scenario categories: Kitchen, Office, Garden, Livestream, and Workshop.

**Complexity**: Each task requires 3-8 interaction steps involving more than three objects, testing autonomous planning and precise control.
